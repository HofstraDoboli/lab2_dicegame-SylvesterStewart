Add your steps (pseudo-code) for the dice game here.
variables: userInput, roll, num1, num2, sum1, sum2, playersPoint, nrProblems, nrCProblems, nrICProblems, rollNr
I would accept a userInput that would have to be set  to y to start the game.
     WHILE loop 
     roll two numbers 
     print out the two numbers
     take the sum of the two numbers = sum1

    IF the sum of the two numbers equaled 7 or 11 they win

    ELSE IF the sum was equal to 2,3, or 11, they lose. 

    then they would have the option to start the game over

    ELSE the sum of the two numbers were something else, that number would become playersPoint
    then they would use r, to roll
    WHILE loop until either sum2 equals player point or sum was equal to 7 are reached.
    roll two numbers 
    sum in sum2
    IF the sum of the roll was equal to the playerPoint they win
    IF the sum of thr roll was equal to 7 they lose
    
    IF they want to play again choose y
    ELSE choose any other key to stop playing
